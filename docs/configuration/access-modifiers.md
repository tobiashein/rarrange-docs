# Access Modifiers

A sorter can have one or multiple assigned _access modifiers_. The order, as seen in the following table, is also taken into account if combined with the [sort order](./sort-order.md) `accessModifierAscending` or `accessModifierDescending`.

| Name                |
|---------------------|
| `public`            |
| `protected`         |
| `internal`          |
| `protectedInternal` |
| `private`           |
| `privateProtected`  |
